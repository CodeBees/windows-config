Note: this project has been converted to use github, see http://github.com/baohaojun/windows-config 

I hate it when I wrote a small but useful script/executable/configuration, I must copy it to every computer that I use. And then I have to take the pain of always syncing the files on the computers, both of which will be growing/updating.

Make it into a google code project just solved the problem. As long as the computer that I use has a internet connection...

In this project, you'll find a lot of stuff. Some maybe useful, some maybe useless. Here's a short list of things that I think useful (the list is not complete, find more yourself):

  * Windows Manager for Windows: (findexec + ifind + hotkey\_hook)
  * Registry Tools: (regrep.py, regsub.py, regopen.py)
  * Cygwin/win32 integration: (shellHelper\_vc6.exe, shellHelper\_cyg.exe)
